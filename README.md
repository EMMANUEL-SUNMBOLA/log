<h1>Hi welcome to my repository</h1>
<h2>Signup & login system</h2>
<P>In this project</p>
<ol>
<li>I made a system to save customers information to a file after they signup</li>
<li>Log in system added , now registered customers can visit protected page</li>
<li>I've begun merging PROJECT-C-9 with the new signup and login system</li>
<li>Admin page added (for adding product images, prices & description to the page without code)</li>
<li>Admin page functional</li>
<li>Now customers information and post infromations will be saved to a database üòÅ</li>
</ol>
<h1><u>FEATURES TO BE EXPECTED</u></h1>
<ol>
<li>I'm making a system to take orders from customers that are logged in
<ul>
<li>I will do this by adding a custom name to each buy button  <ol><li>I underestimated the complexity of this idea so it will be a while before I finally complete it.</li></ol></li>
<li>Then make a customer folder where every buy button's name will be saved</li>
<li>And the names and products to be bought will be displayed at the admin page </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>What I learnt while making this project</h1>
<ul>
    <li>You can't include/require an entire folder , you have to loop through it's content</li>
    <li>Splitting a project into smaller bits makes it faster to finish</li>
</ul>
